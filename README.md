## ðŸŽ² Probability Distributions

A **probability distribution** tells us how likely different outcomes are for a random variable. Itâ€™s foundational in statistics, machine learning, simulations, and A/B testing.

### ðŸ“˜ Types of Distributions

#### ðŸ”¹ Discrete Distributions
Used when outcomes are **countable** (e.g., number of purchases, clicks).

| Distribution        | Description                                      | Example                              |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Bernoulli**        | Binary outcomes (0 or 1)                         | Click vs. No Click                   |
| **Binomial**         | Number of successes in `n` trials                | 8 successes in 10 email sends        |
| **Poisson**          | Count of events in a fixed time/space            | Number of users arriving per hour    |

#### ðŸ”¸ Continuous Distributions
Used when outcomes can take **any value** within a range (e.g., height, weight, session time).

| Distribution        | Description                                      | Example                              |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Normal (Gaussian)** | Bell-shaped curve; many natural processes       | Heights, test scores, etc.           |
| **Exponential**       | Time between events in a Poisson process        | Time until next user joins           |
| **Uniform**           | All values equally likely within a range        | Random number between 0 and 1        |

### ðŸ“ˆ Why It Matters

- Understanding distributions helps you **model uncertainty**
- Useful in **simulations**, **inference**, **machine learning**, and **decision making**
- Helps pick the right statistical test and evaluate model assumptions
